Human beings always try to leave behind their offspring, to pass on their knowledge and skills to them. It has been like this for centuries, and it will continue to be so. That's the way we're meant to be. But everything has another side, and for us, people, it is indulgence of our animal part. The desire to live here and now, to get everything at once, leaving nothing for future generations is the scourge of modernity.
Some corporations pretend to work for the sake of the future, but in reality they work only for the needs of the upper class. This is how our integrity, our essence, is destroyed. Our future. And look where it's gotten us.
It is my pleasure to pull out all the unpleasant secrets of such corporations, to destroy them with purpose. And when all that's left of them is ash, I shall have a smile on my face.

Greetings!

Two days ago we left a request for cleaning in building C, but we have not received a reply. I am sending the request again.
The toilet on the third floor is clogged. One of the staff members poured out a bottle of pipe cleaner without reading the instructions. We are in urgent need of cleaning service. I am attaching photos to the letter to help you understand the magnitude of this issue.
Please send the cleaning service as soon as possible or we will have to reassign employees to remote work.

Respectfully,
■■■■■■■■■

Dear ■■■■■■!

The product trials have been concluded positively. The subjects have shown excellent results. The death rate is low. I will send details in the next email along with a 42-page report. Mr. (name illegible) has agreed to start production. Storage will be conducted in warehouse 6.

Respectfully,

Greetings!

Where the fuck are the label B barrels then? Where did they go? Did you leave them there? If so, get ready to lose your jobs, you blind dickheads! I'd tell you what you've lost, but that's classified information.

Sincerely,
